### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This GitHub page aims to gather the work I accomplish throughout my studies and personal projects.

I mostly (but not only) work on applied mathematics, industrial engineering optimization, and computational social sciences.

I am currently working / have worked on
- Web Scraping
- Meta-heuristics for non-linear optimization problem solving
- Machine Learning (NLP, GNN, Sentiment Analysis)
- Data Analysis
- graph optimization
- computational sociology
- predictive statistical models

I am also learning/using models like xgboost, and I like experimenting on Hugging Face models and their finetuning interface AutoTrain.

Feel free to reach out to me (see links on my Profile) !
